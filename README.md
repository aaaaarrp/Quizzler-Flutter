# Quizzler ‚ùì

I made this app when I was learning about Dart's Stateful - Stateless Widgets and the fundamental building blocks of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - Classes and Objects - A part of Angela Yu's Flutter course.


This is a quiz app that tests general knowledge. As one of the most popular types of apps on the app stores, you can create your own quiz for other people to enjoy!
